Volvo ME7 Checksum Updater
==========================
This is a utility to update the checksums in a Volvo ME7 BIN file. It constantly monitors a directory for files with incorrect checksums and will update them, if necessary. It will only process files that are 512KB or 1MB in size and that end with an extension of .bin

To install, please use the setup utility.
